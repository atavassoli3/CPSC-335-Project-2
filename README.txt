Class number: CPSC-335-03
Project Number: 2
Project Name: Sort Race
Team name: Bungalow 
Team Members:  Thomas Smith, Vincent DeAugustine, Matthew Quinlan

Intro: For this project, our group created a program that runs three different sorting algorithms simultaneously to 
demonstrate the differences in time and complexity. The program is written in Javascript, P5.JS, CSS, and HTML.

Contents:
README.txt -- This file.
Script1.js -- The Javascript file containing the source code for this project, and the P5 key animation functions. 
sorting.html -- The HTML file for running program in a web browser. 
style.css -- The CSS file for describing the presentation of the HTML file. 
335-Project2-Sample.PNG -- The sample invocation of this program; a screenshot of the program running. 
Analysis.PDF -- a 1-page paper describing our analysis of the running time of each algorithm as we have implemented it.

External Requirements: NONE 

Set Up and Installation:

To set up and run this program on any Operating System:
1. Download the zip file and extract its contents. 

2. In order to turn in this project via email, we were instructed to add '.txt' to all of our JS files. There is only one JS file for this program. Locate 
   Script1.js.txt and remove the '.txt' from its name. Save the file with this new name. 

3. Open the HTML file in any web browser. You can do this by simply double clicking the file or dragging the HTML file into your web browser window. 

4. That's it. The program should run in your browser with no issues as long as the Script1.js, HTMLPage1.html, and style.css files are all in the same directory. 
   You should see the title and header appear and the animation should begin. 


Included Features:
Simulatneous animation of Gold's Poresort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort 

Bugs: NONE observed

Warning: Animation restarts if you hit the refresh button on your web browser.
